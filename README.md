## StarterCode for this project:

<a href="https://github.com/rhildred/ES6OrderBot" target="_blank">ES6 Order Bot</a>

## To run

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case.

## Assignment 1

Create an order bot for your favourite food. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

## Marking

basic order for an item in a zip (65%)
2nd or 3rd item (up to 10%)
up-sell item other than drinks (up to 10%)
estimated price or ability for someone in the store to see the orders with their phone (up to 15%)

## What I added

pizza and steak menu items
upsell of dessert for steak order
Instantiation of new Orders
Feature to select menu item of choice
Order summary generator
Price estimate feature as well
