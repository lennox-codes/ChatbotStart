## StarterCode for this project:

<a href="https://github.com/rhildred/ES6OrderBot" target="_blank">ES6 Order Bot</a>

## To run

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case.

## Assignment 1

Create an order bot for your favourite food. You need to have at least 2 items on the menu unless your favourite food is pizza in which case you need to have 3 (I did pizza already). The menu items need to have size and one other attribute like toppings. You also need an up-sell item like drinks in the example.

## Marking

- Basic order for an item in a zip (65%)
- 2nd or 3rd item (up to 10%)
- Up-sell item other than drinks (up to 10%)
- Estimated price or ability for someone in the store to see the orders with their phone (up to 15%)

## What I added

- Pizza and steak menu items
- Upsell of dessert for steak order
- Ability to perform instantiation of new order/menu items
- Feature to select menu item of choice
- Order summary generator
- Price estimate feature
